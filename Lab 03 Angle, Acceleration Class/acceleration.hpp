 * 1. Name:
 *      Mark Van Horn & Taden Marston
 * 2. Assignment Name:
 *      Lab 03: Apollo 11 Angle, Acceleration Class
 * 3. Assignment Description:
 *      A class to represent an angle
 * 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
 *      This one was a learning process for us. Once we got the
 *      program to compile we got a ton of failed tests, but after
 *      an extremely helpful consultation we began the debugging
 *      process which solved 89.7% of our problems, we then got
 *      very stuck on the display portion, which was highly
 *      frustrating because while the output was exactly what was
 *      listed in the tests, the tests failed.
 * 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
 *      2.5 hours :(
